Post availability 
*
Here we code whether the post is still available or whether it has been deleted in the meantime (which can be recognized, for example, if the browser shows a “404 error”).

ATTENTION: It is important here to check the original post.

Section 2 of 13
Section title (optional)
For the encoding of the following categories, only the information at the image and/or video level is used. The texts at the status/text level are only used in exceptional cases if they can serve as contextual information for more precise coding. 

This category refers only to the first AI image and video along with their textual content. In the case of video, the first minute is used for coding (after e.g. still images). Only if the image topic is not clear without context and the category to be coded does not change by adding more information, the caption, geodata, and links and hashtags can help with identification and encoding. Note: if post is a carousel please do click through all posts once and code the first AI image/video (if there is one). 

Text on images should be coded as part of the image. 


Image(s)/Video(s) included

*
Here it is coded whether an image or video is included in the post. “Video(s) included” also refers to embedded YouTube videos or image carousels.

Text only
One or more images included
One or more videos included
Both image(s) and video(s) included

Section 3 of 13
AI-Generated Images/Videos


Here it is coded whether the displayed images are AI-generated. In a world where machine learning and AI models are becoming increasingly powerful, AI-generated images are gaining significance — also in election campaigns. They may include photos, digital artworks, 3D models, graphics, and much more. To identify AI-generated images, the instructions in the codebook are taken into account.

AI Image/Video

*
Is the image or video (or parts of it) generated with Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

WE CODE ONLY THE IMAGE/VIDEO CONTENT AND NOT TEXT/TEXT OVERLAYS/TEXT BINDINGS

Yes, the image/video is COMPLETELY AI-generated
The image/video is PARTLY AI-generated, meaning it contains both AI-generated and real or “photoshopped” content.
No, the image/video is NOT AI-generated / It is completely real or “photoshopped”
I am unsure whether the image/video (or parts of it) is AI-generated
After section 3
Section 4 of 13
AI Labeling
Here we code whether the image/video contains a disclaimer as lettering or overlay that draws attention to the fact that it is AI-generated image content or video sequences. 
AI Labeling in Image/Video

The image/video contains a disclaimer labeling content/sequences as AI-generated
The image/video does NOT contain a disclaimer labeling content/sequences as AI-generated
AI Labeling in Post Text

(When the text of the post provides a reference to AI. Either with a source or when the sender writes: “This is AI,” “We use AI,” “AI was used here,” etc.)

The post text contains a disclaimer labeling image/video content/sequences as AI-generated
The post text does NOT contain a disclaimer labeling image/video content/sequences as AI-generated
AI Labeling in Post/Ad

IMPORTANT: Please view the post on your smartphone to code this category because platform disclaimers don´t appear on desktop browsers!

The post/ad contains a disclaimer labeling content/sequences as AI-generated
The post/ad does NOT contain a disclaimer labeling content/sequences as AI-generated
After section 4
Section 5 of 13
Content of the Image/Video
For coding the following categories, only the information visible on the image and/or video level is used. Texts at the status/text level are only used in exceptional cases if they serve as necessary context for more accurate coding.

This category refers only to the first image and the first video together with their textual content. For videos, the first minute is used for coding (e.g., still frames). Only if the image theme is unclear without context and the coding category cannot be determined otherwise, captions, geodata, links, and hashtags may help with identification and coding.


Text on images should be coded as part of the image.

Theme of the Image/Video
*
CODING REFERS ONLY TO IMAGE/VIDEO CONTENTS

Here the central thematic aspects of the image/video are analyzed. For this purpose, images and videos are checked for the presence of different content types: campaign material, poll results, campaign events, individual voter contact, prominent supporters, ordinary supporters, media work, TV debate, political positioning, private background story, everyday politics, negative campaigning, and travel aspects. For each image type, it must be determined whether it is present (1) or not (0). The same image/video can be coded into multiple categories (e.g., when different things are shown in the first minute of a video).

Event announcement/Election call/Candidate presentation
Political positioning
Negative imagery/Negative campaigning: The image/video portrays the political opponent in a negative light. This can happen through sharp criticism or with humor.
Positive imagery/Acclaims: The image/video portrays past and future achievements of the party/government in a positive light. This includes drawing a positive balance, saying “thank you” to campaign helpers, or positively discussing political plans/goals.
Symbolic image of person(s)/politician(s)/citizen(s) looking directly into the camera (classic campaign poster image).
Events/Landscape & city scenes: Unlike a symbolic image, people/politicians are doing something, moving, or working (e.g., groups such as politicians, refugees, farmers, protesters, police officers, etc.). Alternatively, a city or (natural) landscape is shown where something is happening (e.g., forest dieback, fire, or flooding, nuclear power plants or wind turbines).
Image from a campaign event
Individual voter contact
Media work (incl. TV debate)
Private background story
Everyday politics
Nostalgic / historical Dutch imagery (references to glorified past or national symbols)
Humor / Satire (depictions used to mock, exaggerate, or parody)
Fantasy / futuristic scenarios or depictions of imagined or speculative realities (utopian or dystopian future Netherlands)
Other imagery
Nature of the Image/Video
The image/video contains real-looking content or gives the impression of showing real objects, people, or events (Could the image/video also have been captured with a camera?).

The image/video does NOT contain real-looking content or does not give the impression of showing real objects, people, or events (e.g., graphics, drawings, cartoons, illustrations).

Number of People in the Image/Video
*
First, it is coded whether and how many (REAL and UNREAL human) people can be seen in the post. A person’s face should, but does not always have to, be visible. If “something” is clearly a person, it counts as one here. For videos, you should count how many people are visible overall (not necessarily at the same time).

ALSO CODE CLEARLY HUMAN BODY PARTS (hand, legs, back view) AS PERSON.

If a photo of a person (election poster) is photographed again, it should also be coded as a person.

No person shown
Person(s) shown

People in the Image/Video
Description (optional)

People in the Image/Video
*
This category refers only to the first image and the first video together with their textual content. For videos, the first minute is used for coding (e.g., after still frames).

Here it is coded which people appear in the post. For each listed category, it must be determined whether it is present in the post (1) or not (0).


Tip: If there is uncertainty in identifying a person, Google can be used for additional research (e.g., reverse image search). Additionally, if there is still uncertainty, the post can be shared within the team so all group members can help with identification.


Ordinary people / average citizens / ordinary supporters (e.g., individuals as well as groups of citizens such as teachers, pensioners, students, caregivers, etc.)
(Members of) minorities, e.g., refugees, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, Jewish people, women (when women are explicitly labeled, depicted, or referred to as a minority)
Illegal actors, criminals, offenders, terrorists, extremists / extremist groups. Actors who commit generally criminally relevant actions without being associated with a specific party, business, (non-terrorist) organization, or (non-extremist) social movement (please code them accordingly); actors who plan and carry out criminal activities in a structured group; actors who use violence

The central theme can be a specific issue (e.g., a political or societal debate) and/or an event (e.g., an election, a vote, a parliamentary or judicial decision, a terrorist act). A person can also be the theme of the post.

Election in general (electoral system, campaign events, campaign dates, campaign appearances, election polls)
Political parties and politicians (candidate presentation; politicians as the main subject)
Call to vote / get-out-the-vote call (WITHOUT AND WITH NAMING OF PARTY(S)

Communication Style: Negative Campaigning & Acclaims

All categories under Negative Campaigning & Acclaims refer to the entire post, including the first image, the first minute of the first video, captions, geotags, hashtags, and links. All categories that are present in a post are coded with “1”; all categories that are not present are coded with “0.”

Negative Tendency/Tonality
*
A post may contain negative texts/images/videos or emotions about a problem, a topic, or a political actor. Negative tendency/tonality is determined by the overall impression of the statements, images, and emotions in the post. Coding is based on the tone/value of the statements, images, and emotions as perceived by an average reader when viewing the post.

For each post, code whether it contains negative statements (1) or not (0).


Important: If both negative and positive statements are present, code negative statements as present (“1”).

Acclaim (“Recognition/Applaud”)
Another strategy besides “negative campaigning” is to present one’s own topics and politicians, as well as the previous work of politicians from one’s own party, in a positive light. This strategy can, but does not have to, be used to contrast positive achievements of one’s own party or candidate with the negative achievements of political opponents.


“Acclaim” is used to “applaud” one’s own party or candidate. This strategy shows voters why it is worthwhile to vote for one’s own party.

Positive Tendency/Tonality
*

A post may contain approval expressed through images or emotions about a problem, a topic, or a political actor. This tendency is derived from the overall impression of the statements, images, and emotions contained in the post. Coding is based on the tone/value of the statements, images, and emotions as perceived by an average reader when viewing the post.
